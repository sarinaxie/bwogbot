# bwogbot

BwogBot reads a file and finds the number of times a word appears in the file using SeparateChainingMap.

(I wrote that I implemented BwogBot with AVL trees but I didn't...this repo contains AvlMap, AvlTree, Map, and Pair anyway just in case you felt like an extra dose of data structures today.)
